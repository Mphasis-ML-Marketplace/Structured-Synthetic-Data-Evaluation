# Structured-Synthetic-Data-Evaluation

## Product overview

Synthetic Data is pertinent to deriving business insights without compromising on privacy. Synthetic Data Evaluation is a process to audit your synthetic data for ensuring high utility and privacy in downstream usecases. The evaluation is done on attribute similarity (statistical similarity, tabular correlation difference), model detection metrics (ability to segregate synthetic and original data points), missing levels in categorical attributes, privacy at risk data points and sensitive data retrieval (adversarial attack easiness). This solution provides an assessment of your provided synthetic structured data on the basis of these metrics.
